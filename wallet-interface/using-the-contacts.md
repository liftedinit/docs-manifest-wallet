# Using the Contacts

The Contacts in Alberto Wallet is designed to simplify your transactions by allowing you to store and manage frequently used contacts. This section will guide you through adding, editing, and removing contacts, ensuring that you can quickly and accurately send tokens without having to manually enter long wallet addresses each time.

### Adding Contacts

* **Navigate to Contacts:**\
  From the main navigation menu, select **Contacts** to view your existing contacts.
* **Add a New Contact:**\
  Click the **Add New Contact** button. You will be prompted to enter the contact’s name and wallet address.
* **Save the Contact:**\
  Once you’ve entered all the necessary information, click **Save** to add the new contact to your Contacts.

### Editing Contacts

* **Locate the Contact:**\
  In Contacts, find the contact you wish to update.
* **Edit Details:**\
  Click the **Edit** icon next to the contact’s entry. Update the contact’s name and wallet address.
* **Update:**\
  After making the changes, click **Save** to save your modifications.

### Removing Contacts

* **Find the Contact:**\
  Within the Contacts, locate the contact you want to remove.
* **Delete Contact:**\
  Click the **Delete** icon next to the contact’s details. This action will permanently remove the contact from your Contacts.

### Backing Up and Restoring Contacts

**Important:** Contacts are stored locally in your browser's storage. This means that if you close the page or clear your browser data without exporting your contacts first, you will lose all the contacts stored in Contacts.

* **Exporting Contacts:**\
  In the Contacts view, click the **Export** button. This will generate and download a JSON file containing all your contacts. Keep this file in a secure location as a backup.
* **Importing Contacts:**\
  If you need to restore your contacts, click the **Import** button and select the previously exported JSON file. This will repopulate your Contacts with your saved contacts.

By regularly exporting your contacts, you ensure that your Contacts data is safely backed up and can be easily restored if needed.

### Using Contacts Across the Application

Contacts in Alberto Wallet are supported across the entire application. Whenever a wallet address is expected—whether you're sending tokens in the Bank section, setting up group members, or managing token transfers—you can simply click the **Contacts** icon. This allows you to select a stored contact directly, reducing errors and speeding up the process.
