# Using the Groups

The Groups section in Alberto Wallet is designed to foster collaboration and decentralized decision-making within your community. Within a group, you can propose and execute various actions—whether it's updating group details, adding or removing members, transferring assets, or creating and managing tokens. These actions, treated as proposals, empower every member to contribute to the group's direction.

### Creating and Managing Groups

1. **Access Group Page:**\
   From the main navigation, select “Group” to view your existing groups or start a new one.
2. **Create a New Group:**\
   Click the **Create New Group** button. You’ll be prompted to provide a group title, a brief description, and list the authors. Once completed, click **Next: Group Members** to start adding members by entering their wallet addresses and names. Then, proceed to **Next: Group Policy** where you define key parameters—such as the proposal voting period (the time window during which group members can vote on any proposal) and the qualified majority (the minimum number of “Yes” votes required for a proposal to pass). When everything is set to your liking, click **Next: Confirmation** to review the details, and finally, click **Sign Transaction** to create the group.
3. **Manage Group Settings:**\
   After a group is created, you can adjust its settings to better suit your needs. From the main navigation, select **Group** and click the **Group Details** icon. Here, you can:
   * **Update Group Information:**\
     Click the **Update** button to change the group title, description, or other settings.
   * **Leave the Group:**\
     If you no longer wish to participate, select the **Leave Group** option from the Group Details view.

### Creating Proposals through Group Actions

In Alberto Wallet, proposals are initiated by performing specific actions within your group. These proposals can include:

* **Updating Group Details:** Changing the group title, description, or other settings.
* **Managing Membership:** Adding new members or removing existing ones.
* **Transferring Assets:** Initiating asset transfers among group members.
* **Token Operations:** Creating new tokens, minting or burning tokens, transferring token ownership, and updating token metadata.

When you perform any of these actions, a proposal is generated. The proposal details are automatically recorded and made available for all group members to review.

### Voting on Proposals

1. **Cast Your Vote:**\
   Once a proposal is submitted, each group member can review the details and cast their vote—either in favor or against the proposal. The voting period for each proposal is determined by the group’s policy, and a countdown timer is displayed in the proposal detail view to show how much time remains for voting.
2. **Single Vote Policy:**\
   Each member can vote only once, and once cast, your vote cannot be changed. This ensures the integrity and finality of the decision-making process.
3. **Proposal Withdrawal:**\
   The user who initiated the proposal retains the option to withdraw it at any time during the voting period, in case they decide not to move forward with the proposed action.
4. **Track the Voting Process:**\
   The proposal interface displays a real-time tally, ensuring transparency as votes accumulate.

### Executing Proposals

1. **Approval and Execution:**\
   When a proposal meets the defined vote threshold (qualified majority), it becomes eligible for execution. Anyone can trigger the execution of the approved proposal.
2. **Confirm and Finalize:**\
   Review the proposal one final time, then click the **Execute** button. Once executed, the proposed changes (e.g., updated group settings, new membership, asset transfers) are applied.

### Viewing Group Information

Within the Group section, you can access a detailed view of:

* **Group Activity:**\
  Review past proposals, vote outcomes, and recent group activities.
* **Current Settings:**\
  See up-to-date group settings including policies, member lists, and configuration details.
* **Member Details:**\
  Access information about each member, facilitating better collaboration.
* **Group Assets:**\
  View an overview of assets held by the group, including funds or other digital assets managed collectively.
* **Group Tokens:**\
  Check details on any tokens created or managed within the group. This section provides insights into token supply and other token-related activities.
