# FAQ

**Q: What are Verified Tokens?**\
A: Verified Tokens are digital tokens that have been vetted by the Manifest Network to ensure their authenticity. When a token is verified, a “Verified” symbol is displayed adjacent to its ticker, giving you confidence that it is genuine and meets quality standards. This verification applies to both tokens created via the Factory module and native tokens present in the ecosystem.

**Q: How can I be sure that my Alberto Wallet is secure?**\
A: Alberto Wallet has successfully passed a rigorous third-party security audit and incorporates robust security measures—including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for social logins and self-custody options for crypto-advanced users—to protect your digital assets and personal data.

**Q: What is the difference between testnet and mainnet?**\
A: The **testnet** is a simulated environment where you can experiment with transactions and features without risking real funds. The **mainnet** is the live environment where actual digital assets are managed. Always double-check which network you are connected to before initiating any transactions, as operations on the mainnet involve real tokens and irreversible actions.

**Q: Can I change my connection method after creating my account?**\
A: Yes. You can switch between connection methods (crypto-advanced options or Web3Auth social logins) as needed.

**Q: How do I recover my wallet if I lose access?**\
A: If you lose access to your wallet, you can recover it using your seed (recovery) phrase. It is essential to store your seed phrase securely offline. For extra security, consider dividing your seed phrase using a threshold scheme (e.g., a 2-out-of-3 split) so that you can recover your wallet even if one part is lost. Additionally, if you use social logins via Web3Auth, the multi-factor authentication (MFA) setup serves as a robust backup and recovery method. Should you lose access to your primary authentication method, follow the Web3Auth account restore process—this may involve verifying your identity through additional factors (such as a secondary email, SMS code, or authentication app) to securely restore your wallet access.

**Q: What should I do if I encounter a transaction error?**\
A: If a transaction fails, first verify that all transaction details (such as the recipient address and amount) are correct and that you have enough balance to cover both the transaction and any associated network fees. If issues persist, check your network connection and transaction history for error messages, or refer to the troubleshooting tips provided in the guide.
