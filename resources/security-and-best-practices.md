# Security and Best Practices

Keeping your digital assets safe is at the heart of Alberto Wallet. This section provides essential tips and procedures to ensure your wallet remains secure, whether you’re using crypto-advanced connection methods or social logins with enhanced MFA.

### Recommended Security Measures

* **Strong Passwords and Authentication:**\
  Use a strong, unique password for your account. We recommend using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords and avoid reusing passwords across different sites or applications. Enable biometric authentication on your device where available, and consider using hardware wallets (like Ledger) for an extra layer of security.
* **Keep Software Updated:**\
  Regularly update your operating system, browser, and wallet app to protect against known vulnerabilities.
* **Transaction Monitoring:**\
  Stay informed by routinely reviewing your transaction history. Promptly investigate any unusual activity.

### Backup and Recovery Procedures

* **Seed Phrase Backup:**\
  Store your seed phrase offline in a secure location—such as a physical safe—and never share it with anyone. This seed is the only way to recover your wallet if your device is lost or compromised.
* **Dividing Your Seed Phrase:**\
  For added security, consider dividing your seed phrase and storing the pieces in different secure locations. For example, you can use a threshold scheme—such as a 2 out of 3 setup—where you split your seed into three parts, and any two parts are sufficient to recover your wallet. This approach minimizes the risk of a single point of failure.
* **Web3Auth MFA as Backup:**\
  For users connecting via social logins, the Web3Auth multi-factor authentication (MFA) not only secures your account but also serves as a backup and recovery method. The additional factors you enable make it more robust—ensuring that if one factor is compromised, your account remains protected.
* **Exporting Data:**\
  Regularly export and back up your Contacts and other configuration data. This ensures you can quickly restore your settings if you switch devices or need to recover from data loss.

### Device Security Tips

* **Secure Your Device:**\
  Always lock your device with a PIN, password, or biometric lock. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.
* **Use Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software:**\
  Install reputable security software to help protect against potential threats.
* **Be Wary of Phishing:**\
  Only access Alberto Wallet through official URLs and be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages asking for your credentials.
