# Secure your Wallet

Security is paramount when managing your digital assets, and Alberto Wallet is designed to provide robust protection for all users. In this section, we outline best practices for securing your wallet—whether you’re leveraging advanced crypto wallet features or using the convenience of social logins powered by Web3Auth with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### Web2-Friendly Options

For users who prefer the convenience of traditional login methods, Alberto Wallet supports social logins through Web3Auth. This method provides an extra layer of security via multi-factor authentication (MFA):

* **Streamlined Login Process:**\
  Web3Auth allows you to connect using familiar accounts like Google, X, GitHub, or Reddit. These providers manage your login credentials with strong security measures.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\
  When you log in using Web3Auth, you benefit from MFA features. This means that in addition to your password, you’ll be required to verify your identity through a second (or more) factor—such as a text message code or an authentication app—making unauthorized access much more difficult.
* **User Convenience and Security:**\
  This approach combines the familiarity and ease of use of Web2 authentication with the security enhancements of MFA, making it ideal for users who value both convenience and protection.
* **Backup and Recovery Advantage:**\
  The Web3Auth MFA not only enhances your security but also serves as a backup and recovery method. With multiple factors in place, your account remains accessible even if one factor is compromised. The more factors you use, the more robust your recovery options become.

By utilizing the MFA features provided by Web3Auth, you can enjoy a secure and user-friendly login experience without the need to manage cryptographic keys directly.

### Crypto-Advanced Options

If you choose to connect using advanced crypto options such as Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation, Ledger, or MetaMask, you’re taking advantage of methods that give you full control over your cryptographic keys. To maximize security:

* **Self-Custody of Private Keys:**\
  You are solely responsible for your private keys and seed phrases. Always store your seed phrase offline (e.g., in a secure, physical location) and never share it with anyone.
* **Hardware Wallet Integration:**\
  When possible, use hardware wallets like Ledger or Keyst.One. Hardware wallets keep your keys offline, significantly reducing the risk of online attacks.
* **Device Security:**\
  Ensure your device is secured with a strong password or biometric locks. Keep your operating system and wallet apps updated to protect against vulnerabilities.
* **Backup and Recovery:**\
  Backup your wallet’s seed phrase and store it in a secure location separate from your device. Never store your seed phrase online and/or on a computer. For better security, divide and store your seed phrase in multiple locations. \
  This is critical in case your device is lost or compromised.

By following these practices, you ensure that even if one layer of security is breached, your overall wallet remains safeguarded.
